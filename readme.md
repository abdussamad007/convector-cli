# Convector CLI

Convector CLI is the official Command-Line Interface for <a href="https://github.com/worldsibu/convector/" target="_blank">Convector Framework</a>. It is an open source project under an Apache 2.0 license to help you create Convector projects easily.

## Tests üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Download Convector CLI, build it, link it to your global `node_modules`, and  use it.

1. First bring up all the source code dependencies by running `npm i`.
2. Then run `npm link` to enable it globally.

## Usage

Go to the folder where you want to create a Convector project and run `conv new <name-of-project>`. For example if you run inside `~/Code` then the CLI will create the project in `~/Code/<nameofproject>`.

### conv new

The way to kickoff a new project. It includes the posibility to create a new project along a new Chaincode right out of the box. `npm i` and get a project working for you.

```bash
# New project
conv new <project-name> [-c -chaincode <chaincode-name>]
```

### conv generate

The easiest way to include new chaincodes, and model and controller files.

```bash
# Creates a chaincode package with a `model` and `controller` default. This needs to be run inside a Convector project folder.
conv generate chaincode <chaincode-name>
``` 

```bash
# Creates the file in the current folder (by overriding the folder conventions).
conv generate model <chaincode-name>
```

```bash
# Creates the file in the current folder (by overriding the folder conventions).
conv generate controller <chaincode-name>
```

### Example of use.

```bash
# Create a whole project plus a chaincode
conv new coffeecoin -c token

# Get in the project folder
cd coffeecoin

# Add an extra Convector chaincode package
conv generate chaincode productIdentity
```

## Roadmap

Proposed current roadmap. Have ideas? Post them in the [Issues section](https://github.com/worldsibu/convector-cli/issues).

1. Individual generators for:
    1. Project root structure
    2. Package structure
    3. Model file
    4. Controller file
    5. Test file
    6. [ü§ö We are here] Convector Tool: Dev Env and Chaincode Manager
2. Log information to internet and error collection.
3. Unify other Convector CLIs into one.
4. Test methods generation from controller.
5. Versioning of cc creation, distribute different versions of dependencies.
6. Download settings from the internet
